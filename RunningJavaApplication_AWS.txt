For deploying a Java Application on AWS, 2 options are available :

1. EC2 instance
2. Elastic Beanstalk

The preferred choice for this kind of deployment is Elastic Beanstalk

Following are the reasons :
-> It has multiple platform configurations for required application (Java, Apacahe, DB etc)
-> Its a layer of abstraction on top of EC2, hence it can provide following AWS components in single env:
Elastic Load Balancer, Auto-Scaling Group, Security Group etc


We can use AWS SDK for Java. AWS Toolkit for Eclipse to directly push the application to AWS cloud

First sign up for AWS account and then create a Elastic Beanstalk application :

And follow steps as below :
1. Open console for Elastic Beanstalk and Choose the platform and launch
2. Launch an env with following resources :
EC2 instance â€“ 
Instance security group
Load balancer 
Load balancer security group 
Auto Scaling group 
Amazon S3 bucket 
Amazon CloudWatch alarms
AWS CloudFormation stack 
Domain name 

3. After this, verify your environment, upload code and deploy your application
4. Change configurations if needed
